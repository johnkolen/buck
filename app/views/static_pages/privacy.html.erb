  <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
  <p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
    and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well
    beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and
    conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally
    identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
    privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
    and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this
    policy. - See more at:
    <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">
      http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
  </p>
  <p>Users can visit our site anonymously
  </p>
  <p>
    Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home
    page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be
    found on the page specified above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Users are able to change their personal information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> By logging in to their account</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <div class="question">How does our site handle do not track signals?</div>
  <p>
    We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use
    advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
  </p>
  <div class="question">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</div>
  <p>
    It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking.
  </p>
  <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under
    13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
    control.  The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection
    agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
    and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
  </p>
  <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
  <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
  <p>
    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in
    the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
    role in the development of data protection laws around the
    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
    should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
    that protect personal information.
  </p>
  <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
  </p>
  <p>We will notify the users via email</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Within 7 business days</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We will notify the users via in site notification</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Within 7 business days</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
  </p>
  <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
  <p>
    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
  establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right
  to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
  penalties for violations.
  </p>
  <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
  <p>
    To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails,
  you can
